# Reflect - Metadata

The name reflection is used to describe code which is able to inspect other code in the same system (or itself).

A powerful reflection API should allow us to examine an unknown object at run-time and find out everything about it. We should be able to find things like:
* The name of the entity.
* The type of the entity.
* Which interfaces are implemented by the entity.
* The name and types of the properties of the entity.
* The name and types of the constructor arguments of the entity.
